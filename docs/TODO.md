## Security

- [ ] **Replace port 22 forwarding with Tailscale**
  Currently port 22 is open on the router to allow GitHub Actions to rsync Playwright
  reports to the Mac Mini. Tailscale would eliminate the need for a public-facing SSH
  port entirely — CI connects over the private WireGuard tunnel instead.
  Free for personal use, ~10 min setup.
